"Life of Pi" by Yann Martel is a novel that tells the story of a young Indian boy named Pi Patel, who survives a shipwreck and is stranded on a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Due to copyright restrictions, I can't provide the entire text of the novel, but I can offer a brief summary or discuss its themes, characters, and other aspects if you'd like. Let me know how I can assist you further!
